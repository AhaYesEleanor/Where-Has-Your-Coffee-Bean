### Muffin or Cupcake Web App

We are going to walk through the code as a group, and you will be tasked with creating your web app based on the templates that we'll be walking through.

**Step 1: Pickle your model**
* Create a model in Python and save it as a pickle file

**Step 2: You will be working with 4 files**
1. `main.py` - This is the main Python code that uses Flask and calls py_muffins_cupcakes.py to use the model
2. `py_muffins_cupcakes.py` - This is a separate Python script that reads in the pickled model and also preps the data for the model
3. `pkl_muffins_cupcakes.p` - The pickled model
4. `index.html` (in a templates folder) - This is the webpage that will be able to take inputs for the model and output a result on the webpage
